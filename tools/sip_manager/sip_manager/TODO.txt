Sample image from dashboard image cache

http://dashboard.europeana.sara.nl/cache/image/?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fbvpb.mcu.es%2Fes%2Fcatalogo_imagenes%2Fimagen_id.cmd%3FidImagen%3D600940%26formato%3Djpg%26altoMaximo%3D200%26anchoMaximo%3D200

with urllib.unquote_plus() on uri param we find the source url:

img url http://bvpb.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/imagen_id.cmd?idImagen=600940&formato=jpg&altoMaximo=200&anchoMaximo=200


calculate_hash() on this url with give cache item




urllib.quote_plus('http://www.peoplesnetwork.gov.uk/dpp/resource/2301200/stream/thumbnail_image_jpeg')
'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.peoplesnetwork.gov.uk%2Fdpp%2Fresource%2F2301200%2Fstream%2Fthumbnail_image_jpeg'
>>>
>>> urllib.unquote_plus('http%3A%2F%2Fwww.peoplesnetwork.gov.uk%2Fdpp%2Fresource%2F2301200%2Fstream%2Fthumbnail_image_jpeg')
'http://www.peoplesnetwork.gov.uk/dpp/resource/2301200/stream/thumbnail_image_jpeg'
