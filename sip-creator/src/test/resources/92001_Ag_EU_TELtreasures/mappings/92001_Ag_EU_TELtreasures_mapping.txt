# -About this file-
#    This text file is designed as a mapping aid. Based on the analysis file, the person who maps the source metadata
#    element (i.e. the metadata of a content provider) to Europeana Semantic Elements (ESE) should provide appropriate
#    input. On the left, you see the xPath of all tags available in the xml file, followed by >>. After familializing the
#    ESE specification document, please provide the equivalent ESE elements after >>. For example, Measurement >> dcterms:extent.
#
# There are some rules for mappings (Please read carefully):
# 1) Map original source elements to the ESE as much as possible.
#
# 2) Put "N/A" if the element is not important to map to the ESE. Do not make empty elements. For example, ReferenceNo >> N/A.
#    (N.B. All important elements which cannot be mapped should be dump into <europeana:unstored> (See below <europeana:unstored>))
#
# 3) Use the ESE refinement (qualifier) only when the semantic of an original source element clearly corresponds to it.
#    Otherwise, use the upper level ESE elements.
#
# 4) The persistent link to digital object and/or full information page should be described in URL. Sometimes they are
#    re-constructed by both metadata values and information external to the metadata. Those two links are providing the
#    shorter click distance from Europeana to the best resolution digital object display and to the digital object display
#    in context for more information. If only one persistent link is available please map it to the <europeana:isShownBy>
#    element.
#
# 5) In case of multiple dc:Date, insert (YEAR) to indicate a particular dc:date used for "When" facet and timeline browsing.
#    For example, ObjectDate >> dc:date (YEAR)
#
# 6) Insert (ID) for the unique identifier of a record. This can be URL, but also string (catalogue number etc). For example,
#    RECORDID >> dc:identifier (ID). This information is mandatory.
#
# 7) If a single element is mapped to two ESE, use "_||_" syntax between the two elements. For example, the element mappable
#    to both europeana:isShownBy and europeana:object, type europeana:isShownBy_||_europeana:object
#
# -About Europeana-specific elements-
# a) <europeana:isShownBy> as a subproperty of <dc:relation>
#    This is expressed by an unambiguous URI reference to the digital object in the best resolution available on the content
#    provider web site. The link to the digital object is mandatory and will be used as a hyperlink associated with the
#    clickable button and clickable icon to view or play the object on the content provider's web site.
#
# b) <europeana:isShownAt> as a subproperty of <dc:relation>
#    This is expressed by an unambiguous URI reference to the digital object in full information context on the content
#    provider's web site. This link will be active in the Europeana interface. It will lead the user to the digital object
#    displayed in full information context on the content provider's web site.
#
# c) <europeana:userTag>
#    User created tags through the Europeana interface. Mapping is not needed, so please do not use it in this mapping aid.
#
# d) <europeana:unstored>
#    Dump all "interesting" unmappable elements into this single field for indexing. It is not necessary to map all available
#    elements.
#
# e) <europeana:object>
#    URL of a digital object to generate its thumbnail/sample. This is only for internal use for developers.
