All, or nearly all, project dependencies are obtained from third party Maven repositories.

However, there are some that are not stored elsewhere and need to be manually deployed to a Maven repository.

This directory stores them in a Maven repository format. Then, they are accessed as a normal Maven repository, via a Web view on Subversion.
